## Operations run through an interceptor chain

FoundationDB provides *read transaction* and *write transaction* facilities
to interact with the key space.

Many operations share common concern within these transactions such as:

- Per-cluster space consumption statistics tracking
- Error reporting
- Watch notifications
- Previous key lookup

To avoid repetition in actual handlers, read and write transactions will be
performed as interceptor chains, sharing a number of common interceptors.

`fetch.fdb.store.interceptors` is introduced and provides `mutate!`,
`write!`, and `read!` to run handlers in interceptor chains.
