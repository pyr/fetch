The GRPC and protobuf definitions for the etcd protocol could be built inside
this project with the help of **lein-protobuf** and similar plugins. After
trying these projects, they proved to be cumbersome and to be harder to
synchronize with upstream grpc releases than their maven counterparts.

It has thus been decided to create a separate artifact, **fetch-proto** built
and deployed via maven to provide the generated GRPC source code.
