The Kubernetes etcd3 storage engine is quite limited in
scope. Implementing only the subset used by it allows for a number
of immediate take-aways in **fetch**:

- A much more limited payload preparation facade. Supporting the
  full Etcd protobuf definitions would likely involve going through
  their bean definitions and using reflection, supporting a more limited
  set of features avoids this pitfall.
- A simpler transaction handler
