## Synchronous threading model

The [FoundationDB API](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/javadoc/index.html)
revolves around the Java `CompletableFuture` API and lends itself well to
asynchronous programming. With the help of
[auspex](https://github.com/mpenet/auspex), a purely async model could be
implemented.

That being said, after careful inspection, requests sent to etcd map
to few reads and writes and thus there is little advantage in making use
of the asynchronous properties.

**fetch** will thus favor early dereferencing of futures and use a simple
model, consuming one thread per request off of a fixed thread pool. This
should yield simple per-request and per-operation analytics.

A single pool can be shared between the grpc daemon and the foundation db
transaction engine.
