## GRPC interceptor to perform TLS authorization

While **etcd** supports user and password based authentication and
authorization, Kubernetes only supports providing TLS certificates to
a remote server.

To correctly isolate each cluster, a GRPC *interceptor* - not to be
confused with an `exoscale/ex` interceptor - will be used to extract
the principal from the peer certificate of the ongoing SSL session and
to open or create relevant FoundationDB directories.

Additionally an intermediate component is introduced to wrap relevant
GRPC services.

### Setting up authentication for a GRPC service

Everything goes through the use of the intermediate component
as can be seen in the main system map:

``` clojure
{::fdb             (using fdb/handle [::fdb/cluster-file ::fdb/prefix])
 ::kv              kv/service
 [...]
 ::auth/kv         (using auth/service {::store/factory  ::fdb
                                        ::server/service ::kv})
 ::server/services [::auth/kv ...]
 ::server          (using server/server [::server/services ::auth/kv ...])}
```

The intermediate component is stored at the `::auth/kv` key and depends
on both `::fdb` and `::kv`.

Before the actual RPC method implementations in the service stored in `::kv`
are reached, authorization is performed and a namespaced store engine is
made available to the kv service.

To store and access the actual engine, the GRPC context facilities are used.
In any RPC method implementations, `(fetch.grpc.context/engine)` can be used
to access the storage engine.
